I'm a coder who is fascinated by the various intersections between STEM and the social sciences, and believes deeply in the power of tech for social good! Some languages/technologies I enjoy working with are Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), SQL, and Tensorflow. As of right now, I'm interested in learning more about artificial intelligence and data science. 

Right now, I'm a research assistant at NYU Abu Dhabi's Clinical AI Lab. I completed my Summer 2020 internship in data science at [Agryo](https://www.agryo.com/), a startup making loans more accessible to small farmers with machine learning. For Spring 2021, I'm taking courses in virtual reality, data science, and math. In my free time, I enjoy playing with generative art and reading about interactive design!
