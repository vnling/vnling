I'm a coder and debater who is fascinated by the various intersections between STEM and the social sciences, and believes deeply in the power of tech for social good! Some languages/technologies I enjoy working with are Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), C++, HTML/CSS, and Tensorflow, and I'm interested in learning more about AI/ML, design, and computational modelling. Right now, I'm a Data Science Intern at [Agryo](https://www.agryo.com/), a startup making loans more accessible to small farmers with AI and Machine Learning. I'm also the Director of Web Development at [College Admissions Mentors for Africa (CAMA)](http://www.camaafrica.org/), where I help maintain our website.
