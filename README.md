I'm a coder who is fascinated by the various intersections between STEM and the social sciences, and believes deeply in the power of tech for social good! Some languages/technologies I enjoy working with are Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), C++, HTML/CSS, and Tensorflow. As of right now, I'm interested in learning more about artificial intelligence and computational modelling. 

I completed my Summer 2020 internship in data science at [Agryo](https://www.agryo.com/), a startup making loans more accessible to small farmers with machine learning. For Fall 2020, I'm taking courses in web design and storytelling, machine learning, and computer systems. In my free time, I enjoy playing with generative art and reading about interactive design!
